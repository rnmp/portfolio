The app is coming together nicely. Definitely rough around the edges, but it gets better from here on out.

If you have it installed in both iPhone and Mac, it should sync your data between devices (and backup on your private iCloud). If that's not the case, or if you have any other feedback or ideas, shoot me a message using the Feedback option in the app.
