Excited to share that [Bleep](https://bleep.is) now has a public TestFlight! 

The app is coming together nicely. Definitely rough around the edges, but it gets better from here on out.

## Download Links

**iPhone**: [TestFlight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/bleep-ios)
**Mac**: [TestFlight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/bleep-mac)

The app syncs data between your devices and backs up to iCloud, so you can start on your iPhone and continue on your Mac (or vice versa).

## Feedback

If you try it out, I'd love to hear what you think! You can send feedback through the app's Feedback option, or reach out to me directly.

Thanks for following along on this journey. More updates to come as we get closer to launch!
