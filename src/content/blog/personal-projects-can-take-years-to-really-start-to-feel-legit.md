Personal projects can take YEARS to really start to feel "legit".

I've been working on [Bleep](https://bleep.is) since 2021. The initial concept was something I'd been thinking about since then, but it wasn't until 2023 that I really started to take it seriously.

The app is a way to process information and create mental maps. It's something I've been wanting to build for myself for years, and I finally decided to make it a reality.

The journey has been long and winding. I started with a web app, then moved to a mobile web app, then decided to go native. I had to learn SwiftUI, then decided to learn UIKit as well. I've rewritten the app multiple times, changed the design countless times, and questioned whether it was worth it more times than I can count.

But here's the thing: personal projects are different. They're not bound by deadlines or client requirements. They can evolve and change as you learn and grow. They can take years to feel "right".

I'm finally at a point where Bleep feels like something I'm proud of. It's not perfect, but it's getting there. And the journey has been just as valuable as the destination.

If you're working on a personal project that feels like it's taking forever, don't give up. These things take time. They're supposed to take time. That's what makes them special.

The goal isn't just to ship something quickly. The goal is to build something that you're genuinely excited about, something that solves a real problem for you, something that you can be proud of for years to come.

And that takes time. Sometimes years.

But it's worth it.
