title: How I Think with AI

Some AI-positive random thoughts with some internal deliberations:
- Posted image showing the underwhelming launch of GPT-5 and it seemed to have made a reaction
  - I was half kidding with that image 
    - I am impressed by the improvement in error correction and less hallucinations, etc.
  - But it made me realize that true revolution in AI for me was to think about how it’s evolved my thinking as I can now delegate it. Meaning, I can expedite my argument-making in elaborating theses that I use in my mind to make decisions
  - And therefore, the major innovations in AI are not in the model, but in our experience using AI. Get better at articulating your thoughts to your AI and you’ll get better results, and this is the only thing you can truly control. That’s the real skill
- And the beauty of that is recurring automated thinking I do now “what would my AI say in this situation?” which can help me internally predict behavior and make faster decision making
