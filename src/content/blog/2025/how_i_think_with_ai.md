title: How I Think with AI

Some AI-positive random thoughts with some internal deliberations:
- The other day [I posted an image](https://www.threads.com/@rnmp/post/DNEZWCWS2o0?xmt=AQF0-HzOL9zP0_TDmuwNcuj2RAYAPZ9togh4vhsSa4WDrw) about the underwhelming launch of GPT-5 and it seemed to have had quite the reaction
  - I was half kidding with that image 
    - I am impressed by the improvement in error correction and less hallucinations, etc.
  - But it made me realize that true revolution in AI for me was to think about how it’s evolved my thinking as I can now delegate it. Meaning, I can expedite my argument-making in elaborating theses that I use in my mind to make decisions
  - And therefore, the major innovations in AI are not in the model, but in our experience using AI. Get better at articulating your thoughts to your AI and you’ll get better results, and this is the only thing you can truly control. That’s the real skill
- And the beauty of that is recurring automated thinking I do now “what would my AI say in this situation?” which can help me internally predict behavior and make faster decision making
- Even more random is that it's allowed me to be more higher-level in my thinking than I used to be. Have more perspective in the daily experiences of my life. Precisely because of that "what would _my_ AI say?" question.
- I'm calling it _my_ AI because if you really think about it, everyone gets different AI experiences because everyone asks questions and formulates their thinking differently. That's really cool! That's what's positive about it.
- It is still a bit challenging to preserve spontaneity if you constantly try to automate thoughts without letting them just… be?

**TLDR:** the more that you use AI, the more that you develop your own way of automated thinking, and the more you're in control of your actual decisions, assuming your way of thinking is already curious and inquisitive. E.g. you debate and spend time exploring each thought as needed.
