[New video](https://youtu.be/uzMZMltr9Uc) talking about some cool developments on Bleep and my plans for the next few weeks.

Update 2025-08-04: Not really as back on YouTube as the video was hinting at, but happy to have this on the blog as part of my experience building Bleep. I do still want to make more videos in the future, though.
