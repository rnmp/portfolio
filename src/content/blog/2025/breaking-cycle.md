Supppp. I'm here vibe coding on an air plane as I write this. I'm actually updating yet another blog that will be forgotten. But I love writing so not much I can do there lol.

Anyway, I'm writing to talk about how I broke the cycle of assumed importance when it comes to building things.

I mentioned last year how [personal projects can take years to feel legit](./2024/personal-projects-can-take-years-to-really-start-to-feel-legit). And that is definitely true for Bleep. But it was also my first proper project that I built from scratch and saw it through multiple iterations until I finally launched to an ever-growing population to feel like I'm done with a hypothetical phase 1.

The problem is that I was so sold on making Bleep my life's work that
