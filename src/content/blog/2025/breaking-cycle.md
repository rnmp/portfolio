Supppp. I'm here vibe coding on an air plane as I write this. I'm actually updating yet another blog that will inevitably be neglected. But I love writing so I gotta keep trying to make this a habit lol.

Anyway, I'm hoping to reflect about how I broke the "cycle of presumed importance" when it comes to building things. I'll explain.

I wrote an article last year how [personal projects can take years to feel legit](/typing/2024/personal-projects-can-take-years-to-really-start-to-feel-legit). Referring about the journey of my app [Bleep](https://bleep.is) and how long it took for me to feel like I narrowed down what I wanted it to be.

Fast forward to today, it's been arguably successful in attracting paying customers and active users. I've gotten enough validation to know that I should keep going. But the road ahead feels even more daunting than ever.

Though at the same time, I realize that this pursuit has blinded me a bit too. In my mind, only this one app mattered, even though I also have other ideas and I have things I'm still very curious about.

It may be self-sabotage, but it may also be an opportunity to pause and explore what else it's out there before I decide where I want to put all my attention (if that's even possible.)

- bleep consuming all my attention
- this attention leading to a cycle of a sunk cost fallacy
- reaching a significant milestone but also actively deciding to step away for a bit
- this act of stepping away brought the following benefits
  - remember what it's like to start fresh and full of ideas
  - get resourceful and recalibrate how 

Enter Flow, an app I always wanted to pursuit as well. And its mere development has allowed me to experiment a lot:

- Cool interactions and
- A true rewarding development process using primarily LLMs. Allowing
