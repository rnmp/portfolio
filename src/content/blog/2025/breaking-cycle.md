title: Breaking the cycle of presumed importance

Supppp. I'm here vibe coding on an air plane as I write this. I'm actually updating yet another blog that will be forgotten. But I love writing so I gotta keep trying to make it a habit lol.

Anyway, I'm hoping to reflect about how I broke the cycle of assumed importance when it comes to building things.

I mentioned last year how [personal projects can take years to feel legit](./typing/2024/personal-projects-can-take-years-to-really-start-to-feel-legit). And that is definitely true for Bleep. But it was also my first proper project that I built from scratch and saw it through multiple iterations until I finally launched to an ever-growing population to feel like I'm done with a hypothetical phase 1.

Looking back, for as much as I love Bleep and plan on continuing to work on it, I recently forced myself to think of it as a "completed" project. Completed in the sense that I don't _need_ to keep working on it. People enjoy it as-is, and so do I. It can be better, but it can _always_ be better.

So I decided to work on a new quick project that I had left behind from earlier this year. It's a simple finance / money tool for a specific need of mine: my need to keep track of balances and not much else.

This was the perfect opportunity to try out a much simpler problem and focus on interactions and quick development. It is now on TestFlight.
