*Disclaimer: I apologize in advance for the lack of narrative coherence, I just had a bunch of cool things I wanted to share. I'll be improving and trying out this format going forward.*

January. January. January. Always an odd month for me. While most people are working towards their New Year Resolutions, I kinda use it as a "buffering" month. I slow down my productivity and try to not have plans. Soâ€¦

## Games

Finally got to try [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com) over the holidaysâ€¦ Manâ€¦ I'm in awe that such a polished and well designed game can be made by one person. I won't lie, I'm inspired but also very jealous of localthunk's artistic vision.

The real surprise gaming-wise though was [Dragonsweeper](https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper). I had never played minesweeper seriously before, but as soon as I tried this modern take I was pretty hooked. It's a very simple game but it blends the idea of exploring a dungeon and using your power of deduction seamlessly, and it's thoroughly rewarding.

## Learning AppKit

Whether I wanted to admit or not, I am still very new to my native development journey. SwiftUI is a great technology for someone who wants to develop universal Apple-platform apps. But it can feel very constraining due to it being very "high level", considering the reason why I went to native development is to get closer to the metal and to craft the best possible user experience.

As such, I've decided to learn AppKit (the more robust way of building macOS apps) not by my favorite method of learning (fuck around and find out) but instead by following good old tutorials by [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) (our not-so-local native hero.) I found the process rewarding. So rewarding that I went ahead and asked ChatGPT to write me a tutorial to manually code a text editor using TextKit 2 in the style of Paul Hudson. Paul, if you're reading this, you should make one for realz.

## Marketing wins

Okay I lied earlier when I said I didn't have plans for January. I had one goal: to get Bleep featured on the App Store. And I'm happy to report that it happened! Bleep was featured in the "New Apps We Love" section. This resulted in a nice spike in downloads and some great feedback from new users.
