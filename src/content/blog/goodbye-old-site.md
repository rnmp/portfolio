Today I'm launching my new website at [rolando.is](https://rolando.is)!

I worked on this for about a week at the end of last year. While my previous site was very text-oriented with a strong typographic focus, this new version maintains that typographic tradition but adds more fun on the visual front.

The new site uses [Jugendreisen](https://www.jeanwojciechowski.com/jugendreisen) by Jean Wojciechowski, which gives it a unique character while still being highly readable.

## Why the change?

I am no longer looking for side projects, but I do want to continue to build over a public space to express myself in whatever form I want. This new site gives me that flexibility while maintaining the quality and attention to detail I care about.

The old site served its purpose well, but it was time for something that better reflects where I am now and where I'm going.
