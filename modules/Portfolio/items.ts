My friend Diego and I made a Figma plugin to upload designs as you work on them so teams can build processes around them.

It was really neat, we [launched it](https://www.producthunt.com/products/sensive#sensive) on Product Hunt to positive reception. We even got a few paying customers!

    description: `
Choosing colors is a fun part of the design process. But it often can be intimidating (200M+ colors to choose from!). Coleure reduces the upfront decision paralysis and provides a intuitive color making experience with features like color mixing, proofing, contrast test, etc.

A few years after launching, it got purchased by a media company for internal use, and thus sadly taken down from the public.
